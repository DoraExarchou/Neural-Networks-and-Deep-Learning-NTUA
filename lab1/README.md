## Lab 1: Image Classification on CIFAR-10

In this exercise, we will build an image classifier using Wide Residual Networks. The goal is to modify the network architecture to optimize performance and implement the MixUp data augmentation technique to improve classification accuracy. The dataset used is CIFAR-10, containing 60,000 32x32 RGB images across 10 classes.
